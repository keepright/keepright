CHECK_0010_FILE="0010_deleted_items.php"
CHECK_0010_DESCRIPTION="Deleted items should not be used in conjunction with not deleted items. This can be ways that contain deleted nodes or deleted ways/nodes that are member of relations."

CHECK_0020_FILE="0020_multiple_nodes_on_same_spot.php"

CHECK_0030_NAME="non-closed areas"
CHECK_0030_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0030_FILE="0030_non-closed_areas.php"
CHECK_0030_DESCRIPTION="By convention ways tagged with special combinations of key and value pairs are considered to be areas and are drawn as such in the map. Therefore it is necessary that they form closed loops. Non-closed areas are invisible in the map! The standard.xml file is used to determine which key-value-combinations are drawn as areas; any instance of these has to be closed-loop."

CHECK_0040_NAME="dead-ended one-ways"
CHECK_0040_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0040_FILE="0040_dead-ended_one-ways.php"
CHECK_0040_DESCRIPTION="Streets tagged as one-way must not be dead-ended (where should all the cars pile at the end of the road?). Nodes where just one-way streets begin (or end) cannot be reached (escaped from). Please note that motorways and motorway_links are considered one-way implicitly, so this check applies."

CHECK_0050_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0050_FILE="0050_almost-junctions.php"
CHECK_0050_DESCRIPTION="Streets that have (at least) one unconnected end are examined here. If such an end-node is very close to any other way an error is reported. Unconnected end-nodes should probably be connected to adjacent ways."

CHECK_0060_NAME="deprecated tags"
CHECK_0060_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0060_FILE="0060_deprecated_tags.php"
CHECK_0060_DESCRIPTION="As shown in http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Deprecated_features some tags get replaced by others as new tagging conventions evolve. Consider this as a notice, not as an error. The term 'deprecated' is deprecated; you're free to tag anything the way you like. This is just a hint for new tagging conventions that have evolved in the meantime."

CHECK_0070_NAME="missing tags"
CHECK_0070_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0070_FILE="0070_missing_tags.php"

CHECK_0120_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0120_FILE="0120_ways_without_nodes.php"
CHECK_0120_DESCRIPTION="Ways that don't consist of at least two nodes don't make much sense as they won't get rendered."

CHECK_0150_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0150_FILE="0150_level_crossing_without_tag.php"
CHECK_0150_DESCRIPTION="(Level)-Crossings of railways and highways should have a common node as junction that is tagged with 'railway=level_crossing' if it is a crossing where larger vehicles can cross or with 'railway=crossing' if it is a crossing just for pedestrians"
